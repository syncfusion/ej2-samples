        In this example, you can see how to render and configure the 100% stacked line chart. This chart displays multiple series of data as stacked lines, ensuring that the cumulative proportion of each stacked element always totals 100%.<code> Markers </code> are used to represent individual data and its values.

        <p>
            Chart component features are segregated into individual feature-wise modules. To use 100% stacking line series, we need to inject
            <code>StackingLineSeries</code> module using <code>Chart.Inject(StackingLineSeries)</code> method.
