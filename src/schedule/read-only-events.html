        This demo showcases how to make specific events on the Scheduler to be displayed in a read-only mode. The read-only events
        can be simply viewed and prevented from undergoing any edit actions.

        In this demo, the events that has occurred on the past hours from the current time are made as read-only and
        the CRUD actions has been prevented on it. This has been done by setting <code>true</code> to the <code>IsReadonly</code> field of
        past events. By doing so, the <code>aria-readonly</code> attribute gets added into the event element and differentiate it
        from the other normal events.
