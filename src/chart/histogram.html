        In this example, you can see how to render and configure the histogram chart. The histogram chart is a bar (column) chart used for frequency distribution in which the widths of the bars are proportional to classes into which variables have been divided and the heights of the bars are proportional to class frequencies. The <code>DataLabel</code> property is used to present details on individual data points.

        <code>Tooltip</code> is enabled in this example.
        To see the tooltip in action, hover the mouse over a point or tap a point in touch enabled devices.

    <p>
        Chart component features are segregated into individual feature-wise modules.
        To use histogram series, you should inject the <code>HistogramSeries</code> module using the <code>Chart.Inject(HistogramSeries)</code> method.
