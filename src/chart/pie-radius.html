        In this example, you can see how to render a doughnut chart with different radius. You can use the <code>Radius</code> mapping property to achieve this feature. <code>DataLabels</code> are used to represent individual data and its values. In addition, the sample shows how to change the order of legends for the doughnut chart by using the <code>Reverse</code> property.

        <p><b>Injecting Module</b></p>
    <p>
        AccumulationChart component features are segregated into individual feature-wise modules. To use legend, we need to Inject
        <code>AccumulationLegend</code> module using <code>AccumulationChart.Inject(AccumulationLegend)</code> method.
