    <p>This example illustrates how to load and integrate events data from the Google Calendar into our Scheduler.

<div id="description">
    <p> In this example, we have assigned our custom created Google Calendar url to the DataManager and assigned the
        same to the Scheduler <code>dataSource</code> within the <code>eventSettings</code> API. Since the events data retrieved from the
        Google Calendar will be in its own object format, therefore it needs to be resolved manually within the
        Schedulerâ€™s <code>dataBinding</code> event. Within this <code>dataBinding</code> event, the event fields needs to be mapped properly
        and then assigned to the result.
