        This sample shows four series of columns in which each column is rendered with a different width and placed behind the previous column.

        In this example, you can see how to render and configure the column chart. The column chart is used to compare the frequency, count, total, or average of data in different categories. The <code>EnableSideBySidePlacement</code> property is used to enable and disable side-by-side positioning. DataLabel is used to present details about individual data points.
    </p>

        Tooltip is enabled in this example, to see the tooltip in action, hover a point or tap on a point in touch enabled devices.

    <p>
        Chart component features are segregated into individual feature-wise modules. To use column series, we need to inject
        <code>ColumnSeries</code> module using <code>Chart.Inject(ColumnSeries)</code> method.
