        In this example, you can see how to render and configure each point in line type series. 
        Multi colored line charts are used to represent time-dependent data to show the trends at equal intervals with their individual colors by using <code>pointColorMapping</code>.

    <p>
        Chart component features are segregated into individual feature-wise modules. To use multi colored line series, we need to inject
        <code>MultiColoredLineSeries</code> module using
        <code>Chart.Inject(MultiColoredLineSeries)</code> method.
