        In this example, you can see how to render and configure a spline area chart. This chart plots a fitted curve through each data point in a series. It is used to represent time-dependent data and show trends in data at equal intervals.

        <p>
            Chart component features are segregated into individual feature-wise modules. To use spline area series, we need to inject
            <code>SplineAreaSeries</code> module using <code>Chart.Inject(SplineAreaSeries)</code> method.
        </p>
        <p>
            More information on the spline area series can be found in this
