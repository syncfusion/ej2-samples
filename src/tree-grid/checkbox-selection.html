        TreeGrid mutliple selection can be achieved with help of checkbox in each row. To render checkbox in each treegrid row, you need
        to define column type as <code>checkbox</code> using
        <code>columns->type</code> property.</p>
    <p>Selection can be persisted on all the operations using
        <code>selectionSettings-> persistSelection</code> property. For persisting selection on the TreeGrid, any one of the column should be defined as a
        primary key using <code> columns->isPrimaryKey</code> property.
    </p>

    <p>In this demo, Tree Grid mutliple selection has been enabled with selection persistance.

        More information on the checkbox selection configuration can be found in this documentation section</a>.
