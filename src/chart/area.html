        In this example, you can see how the area type chart can be rendered and configured. It is like the line chart, which represents time-dependent data and shows trends at equal intervals, but the area is closed and filled with the color of the series.

        <p>
            Chart component features are segregated into individual feature-wise modules. To use area series, we need to inject
            <code>AreaSeries</code> module using <code>Chart.Inject(AreaSeries)</code> method.
        </p>
        <p>
            More information on the area series can be found in this
