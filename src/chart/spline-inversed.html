        In this example, you can see how to render and configure the spline type charts. A Spline chart uses a curved line to connect points in a data series.<code>Marker</code> are used to represent individual data and its values.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>Tooltips</code> are enabled in this example. To see the tooltip in action, hover a point or tap on a point in touch enabled devices.

        <p>
            Chart component features are segregated into individual feature-wise modules. To use spline series, we need to inject
            <code>SplineSeries</code> module using <code>Chart.Inject(SplineSeries)</code> method.
